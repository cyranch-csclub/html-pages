		&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! My name is Pratik Addepalli &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt; I am a junior here at Cyranch. My highest level of CS was CS2 which I took last year. My overall coding experience is mainly Java, as well as some basic Python. I've been programming for about 2 years. In my free time I like to do Physics, play Tennis, make robots and spend time with my family and friends!&lt;/p&gt;  
	&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
